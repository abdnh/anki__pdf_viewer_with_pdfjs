Use this at your own risk. This is a prerelease that still needs some testing.



This add-on adds a note type with the fields "external_source" (for a value like "my lecture notes.pdf") and "external_page" (for a value like "123"). This add-on transforms the values you enter so that during review you have a hyperlink on your card. This hyperlink opens a pdf-viewer window which shows page 123 of the file "my lecture notes.pdf". 

Sometimes I notice that a card is too short and the info on the card is not really meaningful to me anymore. With this add-on I can quickly refresh my memory and add additional info from the source to this note.

Add-ons that modify the reviewer don't work on Ankimobile or Ankidroid. So this add-on doesn't help on mobile. This add-on uses the pdf viewer that's also built into Firefox.

The pdf files are only show if they are in a special folder that you can configure from the add-ons dialog. By default this folder is a folder named "Ankifiles" in your Documents folder.

You must only put the file name of the pdf into the field "external_source", e.g. "my lecture notes.pdf". You may not write "file:////Users/myname/Documents/Ankifiles/my lecture notes.pdf" or "C:\\Users\myname\Documents\my lecture notes.pdf". You may only add numbers into the field "external_page" like "123". You may not write "page 123" or "p. 123".

If you create many notes/cards from the same pdf the add-ons like  <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/516643804" rel="nofollow">Frozen Fields</a> and 
<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1247884413" rel="nofollow">Field history</a> make it much easier to fill out these fields.

<b># configuration for your own note types</b>
Instead of using the additional note types you can also adjust your existing ones. This is relevant if you have some custom styling. This requires some configuration:

- You must add the fields "external_source" and "external_page" to the notetypes that link to pdfs. If you don't know what I mean by 'add fields to your note type' watch about one minute of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTKqd4nqsK0&feature=youtu.be&t=22" rel="nofollow">youtube-video</a>.
- You must add the hyperlink to your "front template" or "back template" in the "Card Types for ..." window. If you don't know what I mean by "front template" or "Card Types for ... window" watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgKDRTTTnh4" rel="nofollow">youtube-video</a>. This add-on adds a button named "Ext-Docs-Link" into the "Card Types for ..." window. Click the "Ext-Docs-Link" button to insert the link text into your template.

<b># alternatives</b>
There's another add-on for viewing pdfs on a specific page named <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/879473266" rel="nofollow">Open linked pdf, docx, epub, audio/video, etc. in external Program</a>. This add-on has a complicated setup but offers some advanced features like using a different pdf viewer (e.g. one that allows to edit/highlight your pdfs) or displaying pdf files from any location on your disc. These two-addons are not compatible. You can only have one enabled at each time.

<b># privacy</b>
All pdfs in a the pdf folder are accessible for all the cards you review or previews just as your other files in your media folder.
