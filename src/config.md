If the pdf file is not shown you might want to use the pdfjs version that was bundled 
as the default between 2021-05 and 2022-07. To do this change the setting 
`"pdf_js_version_used"` to `"mid_2021"`.

By default when anki night mode is on the pdf colors are mostly inverted (with some
ugly elements unchanged and some unreadable text ...). You can disable this
by changing the setting `"apply night mode hacks to invert colors by default"` to
`false`.
